Role Name
=========

Infrastructure syslog is a catch-all for syslogs in a specific environment. Works with the Tools team to move the logs off to a remote server for analysis and monitoring. 

Requirements
------------

Only requirement is that this be run ONLY on a remote syslog server. Not for public consumption. 

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: infrastructure_syslog }
