Role Name
=========

Role to create and enable the EPEL Repository from RedHat

Role Variables
--------------

Variables are all handled through the playbook itself during the gathering facts portion. 

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: epel }
